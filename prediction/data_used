To test the model for recognizing emotions we used voice data from RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song). 

Link: https://zenodo.org/record/1188976

It contains voice recordings of 12 actors and 12 actresses. Each recording represents one of the following emotions: neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised (represented by last 2 digits of filename).
The data contains both speech and song versions of which we only used the speech version. 

The author of the model has made use of both RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets.
